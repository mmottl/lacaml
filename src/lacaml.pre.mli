(** Binding to the {{:http://www.netlib.org/blas/} BLAS} and
    {{:http://www.netlib.org/lapack/} LAPACK} libraries. You can make use of
    this library by referring to the corresponding module you need for your
    precision and number type:
    {[
      open Lacaml.S
      open Lacaml.D
      open Lacaml.C
      open Lacaml.Z
    ]}

    To use this library, you should be familiar with BLAS and LAPACK. The
    following
    {{:http://www.netlib.org/blas/blasqr.ps} quick reference guide for the BLAS}
    and {{:http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapackqref.ps} LAPACK quick reference}
    may be useful to you. For the precise description of the functions, consult
    the man pages {{:http://www.math.utah.edu/software/lapack/} online} or, if
    you {{:http://www.netlib.org/lapack/manpages.tgz} installed} them on your
    machine (if you use Linux, they should be in the packages of your
    distribution), read them with Emacs: [M-x man] (under Unix) or [M-x woman]
    (all systems). *)
