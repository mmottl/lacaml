             Thanks to Akinori Abe for the patch!

2015-06-30:  Fixed Oasis-related linking problem (again).

             Really annoying, but Oasis still generates code that prevents
             proper linking.

2015-06-29:  Improved portability to some Linux-platforms.

             Thanks to Akinori Abe for the patch!

2015-06-03:  Fixed Oasis-related linking problem (again).

2015-05-31:  Fixed several offset calculation bugs for certain default
             argument combinations.

             Thanks to Chris Hardin <chardin@janestreet.com> for the first
             patch!

             and complex numbers:

               * gees

             Thanks to Florent Hoareau <h.florent@gmail.com> for this
             contribution!

2014-10-22:  Fixed string handling for new OCaml version 4.02 (String/Bytes
             modules).  Requires new findlib version (>= 1.5).

2014-10-02:  Improved separate compilation and executable sizes when compiling
             with OCaml 4.02.  Added some support for continuous integration
             with Travis.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for the improvements!

2014-07-01:  Switched version control repository to GitHub.

2014-05-23:  Improved library packing, renamed internal modules, and removed
             superfluous Real/Complex IO-modules.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for the improvements!

2014-05-11:  Fixed linking on Mac OS X Mavericks using the Accelerate framework.

2013-12-12:  Added new functions:

               * Vec.add_const
               * Mat.add_const

2013-10-08:  Added new functions:

               * Mat.sum
               * Mat.fill  (more flexible than the Bigarray fill-function)

2013-10-02:  Added new function:

               * Vec.fill  (more flexible than the Bigarray fill-function)

2013-09-15:  Added new functions:

               * Vec.zpxy  (useful for convolutions)
               * Vec.zmxy  (useful for convolutions)

             Made Vec.reci work with complex numbers.

2012-01-17:  Improved build file generation to avoid regenerating
             build files during the development process, which would clobber
             the VCS changelog.  The build files will now only be rebuilt
             manually shortly before a release.

             Added numerous examples from NAG (Numerical Algorithm Group):

               http://www.nag.com/lapack-ex/node3.html

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for the examples and improvements!

2012-12-20:  Fixed a bug in vector functions concerning the handling of
             offsets and increments.  Minor fixes and cleanups.  Documentation
             improvements.

2012-11-09:  Added new functions:

               * Vec.{reci,exp,log,sin,cos}  (currently for real numbers only)

               * Fixed a few minor bugs discovered due to improved warnings

2012-06-11:  Several fixes for the upcoming OCaml 4.00 release.

2012-04-30:  New major release version 7.0.0!

               1) Changed "*int_vec" to "*int32_vec" in module Common.
               2) Added Vec.sort.
               3) Documentation improvements.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for most changes!

2012-02-28:  Previous configuration bug fix did not work correctly, should
             be solved now.

2012-02-24:  Fixed a configuration bug on non-Linux Unix-platforms that
             prevented corrected linking.

2012-02-01:  New major release version 6.0.0!

               1) Switched build process to Oasis
               2) Removed module Impl in favor of a flat module hierarchy

             As a consequence of 2) instead of the following:

               open Lacaml.Impl.D

             The new way of opening double-precision functions is:

               open Lacaml.D

2011-08-09:  Fixed a bug in the work space calculation of sbev.

             Thanks to Yichen Xie <yxie@cs.stanford.edu> for contributing
             this function!

2011-06-25:  Added new function:

               * sbev

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this function!

2011-03-23:  Greatly improved API documentation.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this large patch!

             Renamed a function for consistency.  This breaks
             backward-compatibility, but is extremely unlikely to affect
             anybody so no major release:

               * Common.mat_of_vec -> Common.mat_from_vec

2010-11-21:  Added new function:

               * sbgv

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this function!

2009-10-03:  Minor API change.

             trmm and trsm now have a similar API wrt. variable labeling.

2009-09-21:  Added new functions:

               * ormqr
               * trsm
               * Mat.scal_rows

2009-09-16:  Added new functions:

               * sygv

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing sygv!

               * orgqr
               * lauum

             Added example for QR-factorization.

2009-09-09:  Fixed a few performance bugs.

             Some matrix and vector types were polymorphic, thus
             leading to much worse element access speed.

             Improved compiler selection in Makefile.

             Improved some matrix operations.

             Added new function:

               * Mat.transpose_copy

2009-06-13:  Added new function:

               * Mat.as_vec

2009-06-12:  Added new function:

               * tbtrs  (all numbers)

             Thanks to Sam Ehrlichman <sehrlichman@janestreet.com>
             for contributing the patch!

2009-06-07:  Added workaround for OCaml performance bug wrt. bigarray
             access.  This should make OCaml code perform much faster when
             accessing or modifying bigarrays directly.

             Changed API for Mat.scal_cols by swapping matrix and vector
             argument.

2009-06-01:  New vector functions:

               * Vec.sqrt  (compute square roots of a vector)
               * Vec.sqr   (compute squares of a vector)

2009-05-30:  Major overhaul:

             Fixed too liberal transpose parameters in several
             functions.  The conjugate transpose was not available
             in some.

             Make convenience definitions for pp_num, pp_vec, pp_mat
             available on opening Lacaml.Impl.{S,D,C,Z} to be able
             to print more generically.

             Added new functions:

               * dotu  (only for complex numbers)
               * dotc  (only for complex numbers)
               * ger   (all numbers)
               * lassq
               * Mat.syrk_trace
               * Mat.symm2_trace

             Fixed several functions to allow for complex multipliers:
             gemv, gbmv, symv, gemm, symm, trmm, syrk, syr2k.

             Added new "stable" flag to Vec.sqr_nrm2 if over/underflow
             protection is required.

             Numerous internal improvements to make adding functionality
             even easier and to improve performance and numeric
             stability.

2009-05-16:  Added new function:

               * Mat.syrk_diag

             Renamed functions and changed API:

               * Mat.prod_diag -> Mat.gemm_diag
               * Mat.prod_trace -> Mat.gemm_trace

2009-05-03:  Added new functions:

               * Vec.neg

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing the patch!

2009-04-28:  Added new functions:

               * Mat.prod_diag
               * Mat.prod_trace

2009-04-25:  Major API changes:

             Removed function:

               * Mat.copy (use lacpy instead)

             Modified function:

               * geev (differently named arguments)

             Added functions:

               * lacpy (also copies triangular matrices)
               * larnv (random number generation)

             Fixed Mac OS X build problems.

             Lots of internal cleanups.

2009-04-23:  Improved numerical stability of Vec.ssqr for real numbers
             and zero mean.

2009-04-22:  Added new matrix function:

               * scal_cols

2009-01-21:  Added Vec.sqr_nrm2, which is numerically more stable than
             Vec.ssqr.  Added nrm2 for complex numbers (BLAS-1 function).

2009-01-14:  Greatly improved defaults for printing in toplevels.

2009-01-13:  Added context printing options to matrices.  This feature
             allows human-readable printing of huge matrices by only
             emitting specified horizontal and vertical contexts.

2008-11-12:  Improved Windows portability.

2008-11-10:  Fixed dynamic linking problem on Mac OS X.

2008-11-02:  Added new BLAS functions:

               * tpmv
               * tpsv

2008-11-01:  Added new BLAS function:

               * syr2k

2008-10-30:  Added new BLAS function:

               * trsv

2008-10-26:  Added two new matrix functions:

               * packed
               * unpacked

2008-10-15:  Added new LAPACK function:

               * geqrf

2008-09-21:  Added new BLAS and LAPACK functions:

               * trmm
               * trtrs
               * trtri

             Some minor API cleanups and internal improvements.

2008-09-17:  Added optional jitter argument to potrf, potrs, and potri.

2008-09-08:  !!! WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!

             potri and potrs now implicitly call potrf by default!
             This will break previous code depending on these functions,
             but should be trivial to fix.  This change was deemed
             necessary, because otherwise switching between sytri/potri
             and sytrs/potrs would cause surprises: the purely symmetric
             functions do already implicitly call the factorization
             unless a default parameter (ipiv) is overridden.

             Sorry for the inconvenience.

2008-07-21:  Generalized Mat.transpose to support specifying sub-matrices.

2008-04-23:  Fixed a parameter checking bug for syevr-related functions.

2008-04-11:  Added new BLAS function:

               * trmv

             Thanks to Martin Willensdorfer <ma.wi@gmx.at> for the patch!

2008-02-13:  Fixed a bug when implicitly allocating result matrices
             with user-specified offsets.  It may cause segfaults and
             affects many functions (though it is presumably very rarely
             triggered).

             Thanks to Shun Sakuraba <shun.sakuraba@gmail.com> for
             contributing this patch!

2008-01-11:  Fixed installation of new release.  Added new function:

               * Mat.detri

2008-01-02:  New major release due to restructuring.  The library is now
             packed into a separate namespace (Lacaml), and the previously
             visible Lacaml-module is now called "Impl".

2007-12-27:  Added new BLAS function:

               * symv

2007-11-22:  Added Mat.scal and Mat.axpy.

2007-11-21:  Fixed a bug in vector iteration functions related to
             negative index increments.  Thanks to Fabrice Pardo
             <Fabrice.Pardo@lpn.cnrs.fr> for reporting!

             Greatly improved performance of matrix copying.  Cleaned up
             some code.  Removed dependency on F2C library (gfortran
             should nowadays be linked implicitly).

2007-03-30:  Added lacaml_utils to installed interfaces.

2007-03-28:  Fixed potential GC-bugs.  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-11-22:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-09-15:  Fixed bug on 64bit architectures: Fortran integers are
             32bit only, Lacaml did not account for that.

2006-07-24:  Tightened parameter checks on functions that accept square
             matrices only to prevent LAPACK from complaining (i.e. raise
             OCaml exceptions instead).

2006-07-06:  Added Vec.concat.

2006-06-08:  Fixed some GC-bugs.  Cleaned up C-code.

2006-01-21:  Updated copy of f2c.h to fix size-related bugs on AMD64.
             Fixed some warnings introduced by OCaml-3.09.

2006-01-18:  Fixed a bug in pbsv and sbmv.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing the patch!

2006-01-16:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2005-12-09:  Fixed an installation problem on Darwin.

2005-10-06:  Fixed META-file for better integration with the
             OCaml-toplevel.

             Added new function:

               * Mat.copy_row

2005-09-22:  Added new function:

               * Mat.to_col_vecs

2005-09-21:  Added new function:

               * Vec.random  (for both real and complex numbers)

2005-08-24:  Added a new function:

               * Vec.append

2005-07-15:  Fixed two documentation generation bugs.

2005-07-14:  Major release (version 3)!

             The API has been significantly normalized, simplified and
             documented to make its use more convenient.

             ATTENTION: THE ORDER OF VECTOR ARGUMENTS TO FUNCTION AXPY
             HAS CHANGED, AND PARAMETER X IS LABELED.  IF YOUR COMPILER
             DOES NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT MISSING LABELS, YOUR PROGRAM WILL
             COMPILE BUT PRODUCE WRONG RESULTS.  ALWAYS LABEL PARAMETER
             X FOR AXPY, WHICH IS ALSO MUCH MORE READABLE.

             New LAPACK-function:

               * gesvd for complex numbers

                 Thanks to Egbert Ammicht <eammicht@lucent.com> for
                 this contribution!

             Added specific build rules for MacOS X.  Thanks to Patrick
             Cousot <Patrick.Cousot@ens.fr> for this contribution!

2005-06-20:  Relaxed a runtime check in gemm to let the user specify
             his own "k"-value.

2005-06-17:  New LAPACK-functions:

               * syevr
               * lamch

             New functions in Mat-module:

               * random

             Added pretty-printer for integer vectors to printers
             installed in the toplevel.

2005-06-15:  Fixed a supposedly very rare bug in gesvd and gesdd.

             Changed interface of all gels?_min_lwork functions for more
             understandable, safer usage.

2005-06-14:  New LAPACK-function:

               * gesdd

2005-06-08:  New LAPACK-function:

               * syevd

2005-06-06:  Tightened parameter checks for printing matrices and vectors.

2005-06-03:  Fixed a bug in mvec_of_array (degenerate case when array
             has zero length).

2005-05-31:  Fixed a couple of GC-related bugs pointed out by Saffire (an
             FFI-type checker).

2005-05-27:  New function in Mat-module:

               * mvec_to_array

             Updated OCamlMakefile.

2004-02-27:  Fixed a minor problem with external functions returning
             type unit. Added "CAMLprim" to all C-stubs.

             Fixed too tight type restrictions of axpy.

             Corrected error locations.

             Changed the "trans"-parameter in various functions from
             a boolean to type "trans2" or "trans3", which consist of
             constructors "`N", "`T", "`C" depending on them making
             sense in this context.

             New matrix functions:

2003-12-15:  Fixed a bug in the examples (lin_eq).

2003-12-14:  Changed the signature of a couple of functions: non-optional
             arguments that are overwritten and represent the result of
             the function will not be returned anymore (unit-functions).

             Relaxed the conditions of the license to allow static
             linking.

               Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>

             for this major contribution!

2002-07-03:  Small fix in wrong type declaration in C-code (has no effect
             at runtime).

2002-05-05:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2002-05-04:  Revised the whole installation procedure. See INSTALL for
             details.

2002-04-30:  Updated OcamlMakefile: it does not ask for confirmation
             during installation anymore!

2002-04-23:  Added the file "f2c.h" to the distribution so that people
             don't have to install it.

2002-02-10:  Removed project from Sourceforge for simpler maintainance.

2002-01-04:  Changed the example a little bit to show users functionality
             from module "Vec_D" (i.e. basic vector operations).

2002-01-02:  Removed two more unneeded object files from the f2c-library.
             (Thanks to John Malecki for the hint!).

2001-09-06:  Removed labels referring to standard library modules from the
             implementation: will be deprecated in the next OCaml-release.

2001-06-30:  Removed "Printexc.catch" from lin_reg-example: is going to be
             deprecated in upcoming OCaml-release.

             Bumped major version number: the existing functionality of
             the library seems stable enough.

2001-04-03:  Minor change to make things compile in label mode.

2001-03-30:  Added annotation "noalloc" to functions that benefit from it.
             This lets OCaml slightly improve efficiency of function calls.

2001-02-21:  Updated README.

2001-02-20:  Added additional checks for increment-parameters: this
             prevents segfaults if the user passes invalid arguments.

             Added new module "vec_SD.ml" and supplementary C-files
             for additional (non-BLAS) vector operations. It currently
             implements "ssqr", "add", "sub", "mul", "div" and "ssqr_diff"
             (see module interface for documentation).

2001-02-09:  Added "asum"-function from BLAS.
