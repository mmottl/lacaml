## Changes Before Version 10.0.0

```text
2017-06-28:  Release version 10.0.0:

             Dropped label used by `trmm` and `trsm` for API consistency.

2017-05-23:  Release version 9.3.2:

             Fixed the API of ger and syr. These functions now don't return
             the modified matrix anymore. This makes more sense, because
             addition to the updated matrix is an intrinsic part of these
             operations. You cannot use them to initialize a freshly allocated
             matrix. This change can break some code (rare), but is trivial
             to fix.

2017-05-03:  Internalized some modules to improve type error messages in user
             code.

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for the improvements.

               * Vec.has_zero_dim
               * Mat.has_zero_dim

             Added missing checks for empty vectors and matrices to prevent
             BLAS functions from exiting the program.

2016-07-12:  Minor release version 9.1.1:

             Fixed FreeBSD linking problem.

             Thanks to Mykola Stryebkov <nick@mykola.org> for the patch.

            Improved some operations that can exploit fused multiply add (FMA).

2016-04-01:  Major release version 9.0.0:

               * Vec/Mat.acosh
               * Vec/Mat.atanh
               * Vec/Mat.floor
               * Vec/Mat.ceil
               * Vec/Mat.erf
               * Vec/Mat.erfc
               * Vec/Mat.pow
               * Vec/Mat.atan2

             Thanks to Leonid Rozenberg for the patch.

2016-02-18:  Minor release version 8.0.5:

               * Fixed incorrect comments that made ocamldoc fail, thus
                 preventing the generation of API documentation

2016-02-14:  Minor release version 8.0.4:

               * Fixed a matrix bounds checking bug

             Made Vec.reci work with complex numbers.

2012-01-17:  Improved build file generation to avoid regenerating
             build files during the development process, which would clobber
             the VCS changelog. The build files will now be rebuilt manually
             before a release.

             Added more examples from NAG (Numerical Algorithm Group):

               http://www.nag.com/lapack-ex/node3.html

               1) Switched build process to Oasis
               2) Removed module Impl in favor of a flat module hierarchy

             As a consequence of 2) instead of the following:

               open Lacaml.Impl.D

             Thanks to Christophe Troestler <Christophe.Troestler@umons.ac.be>
             for contributing this large patch.

             Renamed a function for consistency. This breaks
             backward-compatibility, but is unlikely to affect anybody so no
             major release:

               * Common.mat_of_vec -> Common.mat_from_vec

               * lauum

             Added example for QR-factorization.

2009-09-09:  Fixed performance bugs.

             Some matrix and vector types were polymorphic, thus
             leading to much worse element access speed.

             Improved compiler selection in Makefile.

             Improved some matrix operations.

             Added new function:

             Changed API for Mat.scal_cols by swapping matrix and vector
             argument.

               * Vec.sqrt  (compute square roots of a vector)
               * Vec.sqr   (compute squares of a vector)

2009-05-30:  Major overhaul:

             Fixed too liberal transpose parameters in some functions.
             The conjugate transpose was not available in some.

             Make convenience definitions for pp_num, pp_vec, pp_mat
             available on opening Lacaml.Impl.{S,D,C,Z} to be able
             to print more generically.

             Added new functions:

               * dotu  (for complex numbers)
               * dotc  (for complex numbers)
               * ger   (all numbers)

             Added new "stable" flag to Vec.sqr_nrm2 for over/underflow
             protection.

             Some internal improvements to make adding functionality
             even easier and to improve performance and numeric
             stability.

2009-05-16:  Added new function:

               * Mat.syrk_diag

             Renamed functions and changed API:

               * larnv (random number generation)

             Fixed Mac OS X build problems.

             Lots of internal cleanups.

2009-04-23:  Improved numerical stability of Vec.ssqr for real numbers
             and zero mean.

2009-04-22:  Added new matrix function:

               * scal_cols

2009-01-21:  Added `Vec.sqr_nrm2`, which is numerically more stable than

             Some minor API cleanups and internal improvements.

2008-09-17:  Added optional jitter argument to potrf, potrs, and potri.

2008-09-08:  *** WARNING ***

             potri and potrs now implicitly call potrf by default. This
             will break previous code depending on these functions, but
             should be trivial to fix. This change was necessary, because
             otherwise switching between sytri/potri and sytrs/potrs would
             cause surprises: the purely symmetric functions do already
             implicitly call the factorization unless a default parameter
             (ipiv) is overridden.

             Sorry for the inconvenience.

2008-07-21:  Generalized Mat.transpose to support specifying sub-matrices.

2008-04-23:  Fixed a parameter checking bug for syevr-related functions.

2008-04-11:  Added new BLAS function:

               * trmv

             Thanks to Martin Willensdorfer <ma.wi@gmx.at> for the patch.

2008-02-13:  Fixed a bug when implicitly allocating result matrices
             with user-specified offsets. It may cause segfaults and
             affects a lot of functions (though infrequently so).

             Thanks to Shun Sakuraba <shun.sakuraba@gmail.com> for
             contributing this patch.

2008-01-11:  Fixed installation of new release. Added new function:

               * Mat.detri

2008-01-02:  New major release due to restructuring. The library is now
             packed into a separate namespace (Lacaml), and the previous
             Lacaml-module is now called "Impl".

2007-12-27:  Added new BLAS function:

               * symv

             negative index increments. Thanks to Fabrice Pardo
             <Fabrice.Pardo@lpn.cnrs.fr> for reporting.

             Greatly improved performance of matrix copying. Cleaned up
             some code. Removed dependency on F2C library (gfortran
             linked implicitly).

2007-03-30:  Added `lacaml_utils` to installed interfaces.

2007-03-28:  Fixed potential GC-bugs. Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-11-22:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2006-09-15:  Fixed bug on 64bit architectures: Fortran integers are
             32bit, Lacaml did not account for that.

2006-07-24:  Tightened parameter checks on functions that accept square
             matrices to prevent LAPACK from complaining (i.e. raise
             OCaml exceptions instead).

2006-07-06:  Added Vec.concat.

2006-06-08:  Fixed some GC-bugs. Cleaned up C-code.

2006-01-21:  Updated copy of f2c.h to fix size-related bugs on AMD64.

2005-08-24:  Added a new function:

               * Vec.append

2005-07-15:  Fixed two documentation generation bugs.

2005-07-14:  Major release (version 3).

             Normalized, simplified, and documented API.

             ATTENTION: THE ORDER OF VECTOR ARGUMENTS TO FUNCTION AXPY
             HAS CHANGED, AND PARAMETER X HAS A LABEL. IF YOUR COMPILER
             DOES NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT MISSING LABELS, YOUR PROGRAM WILL
             COMPILE BUT PRODUCE WRONG RESULTS. ALWAYS LABEL PARAMETER
             X FOR AXPY, WHICH IS ALSO MUCH MORE READABLE.

             New LAPACK-function:

               * gesvd for complex numbers

                 Thanks to Egbert Ammicht <eammicht@lucent.com> for
                 this contribution.

               * of_col_vecs

2005-03-23:  Added a toplevel-specific module for installing

             Thanks to Liam Stewart <liam@cs.toronto.edu> for this
             contribution.

2004-08-05:  Renamed a constant to prevent potential name clashes on
             Mac OS X.

2004-08-02:  Fixed a severe thread-related bug. The attribute "noalloc"
             is incompatible with external functions that make use of
             `caml_enter_blocking_section`.

2004-08-01:  New matrix function:

               * map

             Thanks to Liam Stewart <liam@cs.toronto.edu> again for
             his help.

               * Mat.init_col

             Changed the "trans"-parameter in some functions from
             a boolean to type "trans2" or "trans3", which consist of
             constructors "`N", "`T", "`C" depending on them making
             sense in this context.

             New matrix functions:

             that OCaml did not detect.

2003-12-15:  Fixed a bug in the examples (`lin_eq`).

2003-12-14:  Changed the signature of a couple of functions: non-optional
             arguments that are overwritten and represent the result of
             the function not returned anymore (unit-functions).

             Relaxed the conditions of the license to allow static
             linking.

2003-12-12:  Released new major version. Please note new module names.

             Added support for complex transforms.
             Allow accessing submatrices using labels.

             Updated OCamlMakefile.
             Changed stub names (invisible to user).

2002-07-03:  Small fix in wrong type declaration in C-code (has no effect
             at runtime).

2002-05-05:  Updated OCamlMakefile.

2002-05-04:  Revised the whole installation procedure. See INSTALL for
             details.

2002-04-30:  Updated OcamlMakefile: it does not ask for confirmation
             during installation anymore.

2002-04-23:  Added the file "f2c.h" to the distribution so that people
             don't have to install it.

2002-02-10:  Removed project from Sourceforge for simpler maintainance.

2002-01-04:  Changed the example a little bit to show users functionality
             from module `Vec_D` (i.e. basic vector operations).

2002-01-02:  Removed two more unneeded object files from the f2c-library.
             (Thanks to John Malecki for the hint!).

             deprecated in upcoming OCaml-release.

             Bumped major version number: the existing functionality of
             the library seems stable enough.

2001-04-03:  Minor change to make the code compile in label mode.

2001-03-30:  Added annotation "noalloc" to some functions.
             This lets OCaml slightly improve efficiency of function calls.

2001-02-21:  Updated README.

2001-02-20:  Added checks for increment-parameters: this prevents segfaults if
             the user passes invalid arguments.

             Added new module "vec_SD.ml" and supplementary C-files for
             (non-BLAS) vector operations. It implements "ssqr", "add", "sub",
             "mul", "div" and "ssqr_diff" (see module interface for
             documentation).

2001-02-09:  Added "asum"-function from BLAS.
